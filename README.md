## Contributing
Go ahead and contribute if you wanna! here's some info on how:
While I do regret my earlier decision of using coffeescript, it's the language I used. Use `npm run watch-game`
to transpile code for the game and use `npm run watch-start` to transpile code for the start screen.  

eventually the coffee code will use grunt instead of raw command line
